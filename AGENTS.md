# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working in this repo. Keep it current when architecture or conventions change.

## What this is

Tmuxifier is a single-user web dashboard for managing headless boxes over SSH. Each box opens
a browser terminal (xterm.js) backed by a tmux session that runs **on the box**, so the work
survives tab closes, network drops, and Tmuxifier restarts — reconnecting reattaches the same
session. Tmuxifier stores **no SSH secrets**; it shells out to the OpenSSH client and relies on
your keys/agent/`~/.ssh/config`.

## Self-contained principle

This project runs from the repo folder with nothing required in the surrounding shell.
Configuration, secrets, and runtime state all live **inside the repo**:

- `.env` (gitignored) — all `TMUXIFIER_*` config, written by `npm run set-password`. See
  `.env.example`.
- `config.json` (gitignored, optional) — camelCase alternative to `.env`.
- `tls/` (gitignored) — `cert.pem`/`key.pem` for HTTPS; the private key never enters git.
- `data/` (gitignored) — `boxes.json`, `fleet-jobs.json` (Fleet Command history), `proxmox.json`
  (Proxmox host profiles with **encrypted** API tokens, SSH management keys, and an optional root
  password — all AES-256-GCM sealed — plus container presets), `provision-jobs.json` (provision
  history), `health-events.json` (in-app health event log), and SSH ControlMaster sockets under
  `data/cm/`.

When adding a new config knob or persisted file, keep it under the repo folder by default.
Don't introduce dependencies on `$HOME`-level state other than the user's existing SSH setup.

Any file that must hold real secrets or PII to run locally is **gitignored and ships with a
placeholder counterpart**, so contributors get the shape without the data: `.env` → `.env.example`;
`config.json` → the same keys in `.env.example` (camelCase); `tls/` → generation steps in
`docs/DEPLOY.md`; `data/boxes.json` → created at runtime (boxes are added via the UI, or imported
from a JSON file previously produced by the export button). Add the placeholder/instructions in the
same change that introduces the file.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run build        # vite build -> dist/ (server serves this statically; build before start)
npm run set-password # writes TMUXIFIER_PASSWORD_HASH + TMUXIFIER_COOKIE_SECRET into ./.env
npm run gen-secret   # writes only TMUXIFIER_COOKIE_SECRET for OAuth mode
npm start            # node src/server/index.js
npm run dev          # vite + node --watch, proxies /api and /term to the backend
npm test             # vitest run (unit + integration)
npm run test:e2e     # playwright (spins up a local sshd-backed box; see test/helpers)
```

## Configuration model

`loadConfig(overrides, { env, cwd })` in `src/server/config.js` merges, low → high precedence:

```
defaults  →  config.json  →  .env file  →  shell env  →  overrides
```

- `.env` is parsed by `src/server/envFile.js` (dependency-free) and folded into the env map as
  `{ ...readEnvFile('.env'), ...process.env }`, so a real exported shell variable overrides the
  file.
- `loadConfig` is **pure and injectable** — never read `process.env`/`process.cwd()` directly in
  it or in tests. Tests pass explicit `{ env, cwd }`. Preserve this.
- `set-password` writes the hash every run but only generates a cookie secret when one is absent,
  so password changes don't rotate the secret / log everyone out.
- `TMUXIFIER_AUTH_MODE` is `password` (default) or `oauth`; modes are mutually exclusive.
  `google` is still accepted as a legacy alias for OAuth mode.
- In OAuth mode, `TMUXIFIER_BASE_EXTERNAL_URL` builds the OAuth callback URL. A scheme-less value is
  normalized to HTTPS, and an `https://` value marks the session cookie `Secure` even when local
  TLS is not configured. `TMUXIFIER_PUBLIC_URL` is accepted as a legacy alias.

## Architecture (`src/server/`)

Modules are factory functions (`createStore`, `createSessionManager`, `createStatusChecker`) with
dependencies injected as arguments — this is what makes them testable without mocks. Follow that
pattern for new modules.

- `index.js` — entrypoint: loads config, fails fast if mode-specific auth config is missing, wires everything,
  serves `dist/` and listens.
- `config.js` / `envFile.js` / `configFile.js` — configuration: the low→high precedence merge,
  `.env` parsing/upsert (`envFile.js`), and `config.json` (camelCase) parsing (`configFile.js`).
- `concurrency.js` — `mapWithConcurrency`, the bounded-parallelism helper status sweeps and Fleet
  runs use so a sweep never opens the whole fleet's SSH connections at once.
- `auth.js` — scrypt password hashing, signed-cookie options (`COOKIE_NAME`).
- `googleAuth.js` — dependency-free Google OIDC helper: authorization-code flow, PKCE, id_token
  payload decoding, and exact-email allowlist checks.
- `server.js` — Fastify app: login rate-limiting, REST under `/api/*`, and the `/term` WebSocket.
- `store.js` — `data/boxes.json` CRUD; normalizes/validates boxes; exports/imports the box list as
  a versioned JSON file (`exportBoxes`/`importBoxes`; import re-mints ids and skips dup/unsafe entries).
- `sshCommand.js` — builds `ssh` argv for attach/probe; **all box fields are validated by
  `assertBoxSafe` and never shell-interpolated unquoted**. Touch this carefully (command-injection
  surface). Includes ControlMaster multiplexing args.
- `sshRun.js` — run one-shot ssh probes.
- `boxActions.js` — `createBoxActions`: per-box SSH operations over the shared ControlMaster —
  ensure/install tmux and selected shell frameworks, the non-interactive `execCommand` that Fleet
  Command runs, and ControlMaster liveness/stale-socket reaping (`isMasterAlive`/`reapStaleMaster`).
- `localShellActions.js` — `createLocalShellActions`: provisions the optional local shell
  (`localShell` = `none`/`omz`/`omb`) that backs a terminal on the Tmuxifier host itself.
- `sessions.js` — PTY lifecycle: PTYs keyed by `boxId`, listeners refcounted, a `graceSeconds`
  window keeps a dropped PTY alive for seamless reconnects, then it's killed while the on-box tmux
  session keeps running.
- `status.js` — per-box reachability/status probes; coalesces concurrent probes of the same box
  (in-flight de-dup) so multiple pollers don't fan out duplicate SSH connections.
- `statusPoller.js` — single server-side poll loop: probes every box on an interval
  (`statusPollMs`) and caches the snapshot `/api/status` serves, so status SSH volume is
  independent of how many dashboard tabs are open.
- `fleet.js` / `fleetStore.js` — `createFleetManager` runs one command across many boxes as a single
  persisted, pollable job (Fleet Command), fanning out at `fleetConcurrency`; `createFleetStore` is
  the debounced `data/fleet-jobs.json` persistence.
- `secretBox.js` — AES-256-GCM seal/open for secrets at rest; key derived from `cookieSecret` via
  HKDF. Encrypts the persisted Proxmox secrets: the API token, any added SSH management keys, and
  the optional root password.
- `proxmoxValidate.js` — pure validators/parsers for Proxmox host/key/preset/provision input.
- `proxmoxStore.js` — `data/proxmox.json` CRUD for hosts, SSH keys, presets, and the optional root
  password; seals secrets on write and redacts them on read (`getHost(id,{withSecret})` is the only
  path that decrypts the token).
- `proxmoxApi.js` — PVE HTTP client over `node:https` with TLS fingerprint pinning, plus
  `inspectEndpoint`. The token never leaves the server.
- `proxmoxParams.js` — pure preset → `pct`/LXC create-param mapping (`net0`, `ssh-public-keys`, …).
- `defaultKey.js` — reads the Tmuxifier host's own SSH public key to inject as the default Proxmox
  management key so provisioned containers trust Tmuxifier (override with `TMUXIFIER_PVE_DEFAULT_PUBKEY`).
- `provisionStore.js` / `proxmoxProvision.js` — debounced `data/provision-jobs.json` persistence and
  the create→poll→start→discover→auto-link-box job manager (the Fleet job pattern).

Web client is `src/web/` (TypeScript + xterm.js, bundled by Vite): `main.ts`, `api.ts`,
`terminal.ts`, `index.html`, `style.css`, plus feature modules — `reconnect.ts` (escalating
backoff), `statusDot.ts`, `fleetSelection.ts`/`fleetHistory.ts` (Fleet Command),
`proxmox.ts`/`proxmoxUi.ts`, `clipboard.ts`, and `termFont.ts` (pure builder for the xterm
font stack — prepends `TMUXIFIER_TERM_FONT` onto the bundled stack (MesloLGMDZ Nerd Font default,
then MesloLGSDZ + JuliaMono fallback); the server
validates the name in `config.js` and serves it via `GET /api/ui-config`, which `main.ts` applies
at boot before any terminal opens).

## Conventions

- ESM everywhere (`"type": "module"`); Node 20+.
- TDD: write the failing test first (see `test/`). Tests use **real code, not mocks** — enabled by
  the dependency-injection factories above.
- Server is plain `.js`; web client is `.ts`.
- Conventional-commit style messages (`fix(pty): …`, `feat(ui): …`).

## Shipping (contributing changes back)

The GitHub repo is **public** — never commit real PII (your domains, public/LAN IPs, hostnames,
emails, box/fleet names). Real values live only in the gitignored files above; committed docs,
examples, and tests use placeholders (`example.com`, RFC1918 IPs like `192.168.1.10`,
`you@example.com`).

```bash
npm version patch --no-git-tag-version # bump package.json + package-lock.json by 0.0.1
npm run build                          # rebuild the web bundle with the new version
sudo systemctl restart tmuxifier       # restart the service to serve the new bundle
systemctl status tmuxifier
# Health check the deployed bind address — derive scheme/host/port from config so
# this never hardcodes your real bind address (the service may bind a routable
# address, not 127.0.0.1, in which case a loopback curl returns 000):
BASE="$(node -e "import('./src/server/config.js').then(({loadConfig})=>{const c=loadConfig();process.stdout.write(((c.tlsCert&&c.tlsKey)?'https':'http')+'://'+c.bindAddress+':'+c.port)})")"
curl -sk -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' "$BASE/"  # 200
VERSION="v$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")"
test "$(node -p "require('./package-lock.json').version")" = "${VERSION#v}"
test "$(node -p "require('./package-lock.json').packages[''].version")" = "${VERSION#v}"
git add -A
git diff --cached                      # PII scrub: review staged diff — no real domains/IPs/emails/hostnames
git commit -m "feat(…): description"   # conventional-commit style
git tag -a "$VERSION" -m "$VERSION"    # tag must match the package/lockfile version
git push origin main "$VERSION"
gh release create "$VERSION" --title "$VERSION" --notes "See commit history for changes."
test -n "$(git ls-remote --tags origin "$VERSION")"
test "$(gh release view "$VERSION" --json tagName --jq .tagName)" = "$VERSION"
```

## Security notes

- The login gate is the crown jewel (Tmuxifier can SSH into your whole fleet). Binds to
  `127.0.0.1` by default; expose only behind TLS.
- Auth modes are mutually exclusive: password mode mounts `POST /api/login`; OAuth mode mounts
  `/api/auth/google/*` and removes the password login path.
- OAuth is hand-rolled OIDC in `googleAuth.js`: state cookie + PKCE, token exchange
  server-to-server, then exact-email allowlist. The id_token payload is trusted because it is
  fetched directly from Google's token endpoint over TLS in the authorization-code flow.
- Passwords are scrypt-hashed; the session cookie is signed, httpOnly, SameSite=lax. It is marked
  `Secure` when local TLS is configured (`tlsCert` + `tlsKey`) or `TMUXIFIER_BASE_EXTERNAL_URL`
  starts with `https://`.
- `.env` holds the password hash and cookie secret, so `upsertEnvFile` writes it `0o600`
  (owner-only). Keep that mode if you change the write path.
- Box host/user/port/proxyJump are validated against allowlist regexes before reaching `ssh`;
  the remote tmux command single-quotes any `startupCommand`. Keep new ssh-facing fields on the
  same validation path.
- WebSocket auth re-parses the cookie header manually (`@fastify/websocket` v10 doesn't populate
  `req.cookies` for the upgrade) — see `isAuthed` in `server.js`.
- The persisted Proxmox secrets — the API token, any added SSH management keys, and the optional
  root password — are the only credentials Tmuxifier stores. They are AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest
  in `data/proxmox.json` (key from `cookieSecret`), written `0o600`, and never returned to the
  browser (host views are redacted to `hasToken`). PVE TLS is pinned by fingerprint for self-signed certs
  (TOFU, like `ssh accept-new`) or CA-verified; an explicit per-host `insecure` mode is off by
  default. All provision input is validated (`proxmoxValidate.js`) before reaching the API.

## Docs

- `README.md` — user-facing setup/config/security.
- `CLAUDE.md` — canonical project instructions (this file is kept in sync with it).
- `docs/DEPLOY.md` + `deploy/tmuxifier.service` — running it as a systemd service (self-contained
  layout, no secrets in the unit; `HOME` set in the unit so ssh children find `~/.ssh`).
- `docs/superpowers/specs/` and `docs/superpowers/plans/` — point-in-time design/plan records;
  don't rewrite history there, add a new dated doc for new work.
